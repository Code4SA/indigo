                <p>1. The timeframes do not include events applications where a land use planning approval is required i.e. where an event is to be held on land which is not appropriately zoned. In such instances, the time frames for a very large event will apply.</p>
                <p>2. If a small event includes food vendors, a minimum of 15 days will be required if food vendors need to apply for licences and certificates of acceptability.</p>
                <p>3. Any event which involves an application for a land use approval and where the approval has not been granted must follow the appeal process as outlined in the relevant land use planning legislation.</p>
